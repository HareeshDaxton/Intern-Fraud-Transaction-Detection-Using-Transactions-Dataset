The simulated frauds are using the following scenarios:
1. Any transaction whose amount is more than 220 is a fraud. This is not inspired by a
real-world scenario. It provides an obvious fraud pattern that should be detected by any
baseline fraud detector. This will be useful to validate the implementation of a fraud
detection technique.
2. Every day, a list of two terminals is drawn at random. All transactions on these terminals
in the next 28 days will be marked as fraudulent. This scenario simulates a criminal use
of a terminal, through phishing for example. You could add features that keep track of
the number of fraudulent transactions on the terminal to help with this scenario.
3. Every day, a list of 3 customers is drawn at random. In the next 14 days, 1/3 of their
transactions have their amounts multiplied by 5 and marked as fraudulent. This scenario
simulates a card-not-present fraud where the credentials of a customer have been
leaked. The customer continues to make transactions, and transactions of higher values
are made by the fraudster who tries to maximize their gains. You could add features that
keep track of the spending habits of the customer for this scenario.
